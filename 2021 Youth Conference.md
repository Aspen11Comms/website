Any youth that is turning 14 in the calendar year of 2021 or any youth in the YM/YW program older than 14 are welcome to attend.
## What will Youth Conference consist of?
We will have a variety of fun, spiritual, and service activities at the stake center on Friday. Friday evening, we will go to Mutual Dell, a church owned campground in American Fork canyon, where we'll have a fireside, some additional fun activities, and stay the night. Saturday morning, we'll have breakfast, a devotional, clean up, and then head back home. We expect youth to arrive back at the stake center at approximately 11am Saturday morning.
